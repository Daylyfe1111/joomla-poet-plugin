# Joomla! Content Plugin for Po.et

The Po.et Content Plugin for Joomla! automatically submits articles to the Po.et blockchain via the Frost API.

Please Note: Articles are only published to the Po.et testnet at this time.

## Installation

Download the Joomla! Content Plugin for Po.et plugin from https://github.com/knowledgearcdotorg/joomla-poet-plugin/releases.

Use the Joomla! installer to install.

## Configuration

First you'll need an API token. This can be created via the Frost Dashboard (https://frost.po.et).

Go to the Joomla! Plugins Manager and click on Content - Poet.

Add the API token you created via the Frost Dashboard.

You can also configure how authorship is attributed to your articles on Po.et by using the Author settings.

Once finished, enable the Content - Poet plugin and save and close.

## How it works

The Po.et Content Plugin will automatically publish your article to the Po.et blockchain when you:

- Create or edit an article which is published,

- Change an article to published from the article list.

The title, description, date created, date published and tags are stored on the Po.et blockchain.

## Verifying that your article is published on Po.et

The Po.et Content Plugin will add a "Verified on Po.et" badge to articles you have successfully published to Po.et.
